# Toxic-Comment-Classification-Challenge

Single LSTM + GRU Model (with Fasttext + Glove embeddings) yields a ROC-AUC score of 0.9867 against public LB highest of 0.9890 <br />
<br />
Tried ensembling with NB-SVM baseline - did not improve score <br />
Need to try out 10 fold CV on LSTM + GRU baseline
